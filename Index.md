 # Project Experience
 ## National innovation and entrepreneurship training program for College Students
 #### Network violence detection based on deep learning  
 #### project process:Based on text detection, an end-to-end Chinese text recognition network is trained through neural network technology. Can not only detect text areas in text pictures, but also achieve accurate OCR text extraction.  
 #### Find the Chinese sentence representation method and get the data for training. And consider using crawler technology to crawl text content on public forums for manual annotation, so as to obtain the data needed for the next experiment.  
 
 ## Federated Learning
 #### Finish the deployment of the framework of FATE( an open-source project initiated by Webankâ€™s AI Department to provide a secure computing framework to support the federated learning), and fish the task of vertical federated learning with a good result.
